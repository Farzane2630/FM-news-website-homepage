### What I learned

1. Contentinfo landmark should not be contained in another landmark

``` <div role="contentinfo" class="trending-content">```

2. Document should not have more than one contentinfo landmark

3. Landmarks should have a unique role or role/label/title (i.e. accessible name) combination
